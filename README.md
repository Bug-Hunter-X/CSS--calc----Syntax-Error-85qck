# CSS `calc()` Syntax Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in CSS: using invalid syntax within the `calc()` function.  This can cause unexpected rendering results or no visual output at all, making it difficult to debug.

## Bug Description
The `calc()` function is incredibly useful for dynamic calculations within your stylesheets. However, minor syntax errors within the calculation can break the entire statement.  This is not always immediately apparent, leading to subtle layout issues.

## Solution
Careful review of your `calc()` syntax is essential. Ensure all units are specified correctly, operators are used properly, and the order of operations is consistent. This is particularly important when dealing with complex calculations that involve multiple units and operations.
